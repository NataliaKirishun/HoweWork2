        <p> Now, let's try to be a tad more serious and take a peek in the past, where does Lorem Ipsum text actually comes from and where in its path it became so darn popular even we decided it would be the focal point of our Lorem Ipsum Generator. Come on, jump onboard as we take a ride with the Lorem Ipsum time machine.
        It all goes way back to 16th century, when an unknown printer obviously had enough of it trying to come up with some dummy text each and every time. So, this dude made a type specimen book using Lorem Ipsum text and … Lorem Ipsum was alive! But, of course, almost every true star needs time to grow in popularity, so it was in 1960's when Lorem Ipsum made it to the »front covers«. It was a major star in Letraset sheets publications released in 1960's. And then came computers and Lorem Ipsum, just like Michael Jackson and other real stars, used new technology and new media to grow even bigger. It was Aldus PageMaker software which gave Lorem Ipsum the opportunity and it grabbed it with both of its legs and arms … or something like that.

        <p> Well, in the first sight, it looks like it. To be honest, it also looks like it when you stare at it for hours. But you see, Lorem Ipsum is not just a Wacky Random Thingy. It has a meaning and even an actual human being author. His father is not php’s rand() function, but a famous and wise (now already old) man Cicero. Lorem Ipsum text originates from Cicero’s text titled “de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum”. No, it’s not about U2 front man Bono fighting against malaria; it’s actually a text about the extremes of the good and the evil. Text was written in 45 BC.
            45 BC is like waaaay back! But don’t you worry – our Lorem Ipsum Generator is made with 21st century technology, so it will give you perfect Lorem Ipsumish results each and every time you use it. Don’t believe it? Just try it!
